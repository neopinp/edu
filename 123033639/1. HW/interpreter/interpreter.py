"""
In a file called interpreter.py, implement a program that prompts the user for an arithmetic expression and then calculates and outputs the result as a floating-point value formatted to one decimal place.
Assume that the userâ€™s input will be formatted as x y z, with one space between x and y and one space between y and z, wherein:

x is an integer
y is +, -, *, or /
z is an integer
For instance, if the user inputs 1 + 1, your program should output 2.0. Assume that, if y is /, then z will not be 0.

Note that, just as python itself is an interpreter for Python, so will your interpreter.py be an interpreter for math!
"""

# print(f"{z:,.2f}")
#print(f"Hello, {first}") # use f before the first string in order to print a variable in {}
# x, y, z = expression.split(" ")


def main():
    math = input("Enter an arithmetic expression in the format x y z: ")
    x, y, z = math.split(" ")
    x = int(x)
    z = int(z)

    if y == "+":
        result = (x + z)
    if y == "-":
        result = x - z
    if y == "*":
        result = x * z
    if y == "/":
        result = x / z

    print(f"{result:,.1f}")

main()
